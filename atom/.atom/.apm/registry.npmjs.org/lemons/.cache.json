The\nfollowing example shows how you would use the LazyResult as part of a React\napp, but since ADTs are simple data structures, they work with any technology.\n\nAnnotated usage example:\n\n![How to use LazyResult in real apps](./lazyresult-example-usage.png)\n","maintainers":[{"name":"nvie","email":"me@nvie.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-06-05T10:28:11.265Z","created":"2017-10-18T15:01:53.349Z","0.0.1":"2017-10-18T15:01:53.349Z","0.0.2":"2017-10-18T20:25:15.618Z","0.0.3":"2017-10-18T20:50:27.241Z","0.0.4":"2017-10-21T12:50:45.161Z","1.0.0":"2017-12-16T09:19:02.203Z","1.0.1":"2018-02-20T21:08:04.490Z","1.1.0":"2018-02-23T15:40:44.465Z","1.1.1":"2018-05-28T08:23:47.922Z","1.2.0":"2018-06-05T10:28:08.539Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/nvie/lemons.js#readme","repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/nvie/lemons.js.git"},"author":{"name":"Vincent Driessen"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/nvie/lemons.js/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"nvie":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"W/\"6bbda378adf3375b840440c04446fa75\"","_lastModified":"Tue, 05 Jun 2018 10:28:12 GMT","_cached":true}
