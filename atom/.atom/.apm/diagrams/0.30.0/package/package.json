See [diagrams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diagrams).\n\n###### Atom Package Features\n - Preview the diagram graphics\n - Real time per key stroke updating of the diagram previewer\n - Syntax highlighting and error checking of text notation\n - Includes an SVG previewer\n - Previewer can be dynamically resized by dragging the left side\n\n<img src=\"http://francoislaberge.com/atom-diagrams/screenshot-atom.gif\"/>\n\n### Documentation\n\n##### Usage\nUse the following flow when working on diagram files.\n\n 1. Install the [diagrams](https://atom.io/packages/diagrams) Atom package\n 2. Create or load an existing **.sequence** or **.dot** file\n 3. Edit them and preview the results in realtime.\n 3. (Optionally) Use the diagram CLI to automatically generate .svg visualizes of the diagram files\n    Run the following from the root folder that has all of your diagram files\n\n        diagrams watch --build .\n\n##### Reference\nSee underlying [diagrams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diagrams) project for documentation.\n\n#### Generating SVG\nThis project doesn't generate .svg files, but might in the future. The current focus\nis having an easy way to edit the content and preview the diagrams that will be generated\nusing the diagrams command line tool.\n\nSee the [diagrams](https://www.npmjs.com/package/diagrams) command line tool for more information.\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","homepage":"https://github.com/francoislaberge/atom-diagrams#readme","_id":"diagrams@0.30.0","_shasum":"62ac686ba9235ce7a6c756636006c285779dfcc3","_resolved":"file:../d-118717-35917-nmudf1.3w5igrpb9/package.tgz","_from":"../d-118717-35917-nmudf1.3w5igrpb9/package.tgz"}
