Based on [Flatwhite theme](https://atom.io/themes/flatwhite-syntax)\n\n\n## Minimal highlighting, just 5 classes:\n\n1. Strings\n2. All statically known constants (numbers, keywords, boolean, etc)\n3. Global definitions\n4. Standard language keywords (def, if, else, etc)\n5. Comments\n\n\n## Comments highlighting\n\nComments are clearly visible. I think if there are comments we should see and read them first.\n\n## Contrast:\n\nFor good readability text has contrast 6:1 and it is consistent for all colors. Contrast calculated with [HCL color model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_color_space). Secondary color contrast is 2.5:1\n\n## Supported languages\n\n- Clojure\n- CSS\n- [Elixir](https://atom.io/packages/language-elixir)\n- GitHub Markdown\n- HTML\n- [JavaScript](https://atom.io/packages/language-babel)\n- Ruby\n- PHP\n- Python\n\n## Screenshot\n\n<p><img src=\"https://github.com/biletskyy/chestnut-light-atom-syntax/raw/master/ruby-screenshot.png\" alt=\"Ruby screenshot\" width=\"782px\" height=\"727px\"></p>\n\nFont used in screenshots [Source Code Pro](https://github.com/adobe-fonts/source-code-pro)\n\n## Install\n\nFrom the command line:\n\n`apm install chestnut-light-atom-syntax`\n\nIf the command line isn't your thing:\n\n- Go to **Settings > Install**\n- Search for `chestnut-light-atom-syntax` and click **Install**\n- Go to **Settings > Themes** and choose **Chestnut Light Atom** from the dropdown menu\n- Happy coding! :heart:\n\n\n### Thanks\nInspiration taken from [Alabaster](https://github.com/tonsky/alabaster-lighttable-skin) skin by [Nikita Prokopov](https://github.com/tonsky).\n","readmeFilename":"README.md","bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/biletskyy/chestnut-light-atom-syntax/issues"},"homepage":"https://github.com/biletskyy/chestnut-light-atom-syntax#readme","_id":"chestnut-light-atom-syntax@0.2.1","_shasum":"9775d02d5be6c2d6f4d700e92a40502846815a8e","_resolved":"file:../d-11821-28946-1e33obl.sd33r0y66r/package.tgz","_from":"../d-11821-28946-1e33obl.sd33r0y66r/package.tgz"}
